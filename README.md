# Side-learning-and-projects
This is a personal repository build over to take off daily 1-2 hours alongside my regular job to excel in Side projects and tech stacks like Web Development, pyfinance, algo tradings and other stuffs, apart from my Data Scientist role.

Here are some of the resolutions:
- Taking time from working days(1-2 hours M to F, no holidays)
- push even small or simple tasks here, for personal growth in techs
- Dedicated 1-2hrs just for coding, not some reading or testing things
- More pushing myself harder on weekends
- Clean codes, with understandable documentation
- FUN!!
- MINI PROJECT BASED CODING
- 1 GOOD PROJECT FROM THE WEEKLY LEARNED TECH STACKS per week!
- Streamlining the day and workflow
